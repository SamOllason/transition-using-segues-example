# transition-using-segues-example

This is a mini iOS application that contains an example of using segues to transition between different
scenes. Users also use an unwind segue to transition back to the first scene ('View 1').

I created this project while learning to use Swift for iOS development and hope it will 
be a useful example for others to learn from.
